# Specification Quality Checklist: Local Web Server

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-08-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [X] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [X] Focused on user value and business needs
- [X] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [X] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [X] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [X] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [X] Success criteria are measurable
- [X] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [X] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [X] Edge cases are identified
- [X] Scope is clearly bounded
- [X] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [X] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [X] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [X] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [X] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit-clarify` or `/speckit-plan`
- All items pass on first validation pass. The spec deliberately treats the
  generated wiki (012/013) and the chat API (014) as existing, reused
  dependencies rather than redefining them — this feature is scoped to the
  serving layer that unifies both behind one local-only address, matching
  the vocabulary and local-only network posture already established for the
  chat API in `specs/014-local-chat-api/spec.md`.
